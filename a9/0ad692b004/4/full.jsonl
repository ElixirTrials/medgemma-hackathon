{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Yes — I checked this in your repo and the failure matches a **GitHub token permission** issue, not a filter syntax issue.\n\n- Your workflow uses `dorny/paths-filter@v3` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.\n- On `pull_request`, `paths-filter` calls GitHub’s PR files API (`listFiles`).\n- That API needs `pull-requests: read` permission for the workflow token.\n- Error `Resource not accessible by integration` is what GitHub returns when that permission is missing/restricted.\n\n### Fix\n\nAdd explicit permissions to the workflow (or just to the `paths-filter` job):\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  pull-requests: read\n```\n\nYou can also put it at job level:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  paths-filter:\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: read\n```\n\n### Why this happens often\n\n- Org/repo default Actions permissions are often restricted.\n- PRs from forks/automation accounts (e.g. bots) are more likely to expose this.\n- `actions/checkout` can work with `contents: read`, but `dorny/paths-filter` on PRs specifically needs `pull-requests: read`.\n\n### Extra note from my GitHub CLI checks\n\nYour local `gh` auth is currently invalid (`gh auth status` shows invalid keyring tokens), so I couldn’t query run details directly from your account in this session. But the workflow content + exact error string strongly points to the permission fix above.\n\nIf you want, I can patch `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now with the minimal permission block.\n\n**Outlining troubleshooting guidance**"}]}}
