Extract all medical entities from the following clinical trial eligibility criteria and suggest UMLS search terms for each.

{% for criterion in criteria %}
<criterion id="{{ criterion.id }}" type="{{ criterion.criteria_type }}">
<criterion_text>{{ criterion.text }}</criterion_text>
</criterion>
{% endfor %}

Respond with a JSON object with action_type="extract" and populate the entities array. For each entity, provide:
- text: the exact text from the criterion
- entity_type: one of Condition, Medication, Procedure, Lab_Value, Demographic, Biomarker
- search_term: the standard medical term to search UMLS using these guidelines:
  * Use canonical medical terminology (e.g., "diabetes mellitus type 2" not "patients with diabetes")
  * Use generic drug names (e.g., "acetaminophen" not "Tylenol 500mg")
  * Keep search terms to 1-3 words when possible for better matching
  * Remove qualifiers like "history of", "diagnosed with", "requiring"
  * Examples: "osteoarthritis" not "OA", "myocardial infarction" not "heart attack", "hepatic cirrhosis" not "liver problems"
- criterion_id: the id attribute from the criterion XML tag above
- span_start: character offset where entity starts in the criterion text
- span_end: character offset where entity ends
- context_window: surrounding text for disambiguation
