Evaluate the following medical entity that failed initial terminology grounding.
Answer all three questions below to determine the best retry strategy.

## Entity
Text: "{{ entity_text }}"
Type: {{ entity_type }}
From criterion: "{{ criterion_context[:300] }}"
{% if previous_query and previous_query != entity_text %}
Previous search query: "{{ previous_query }}"
{% endif %}
Attempt: {{ attempt }} of 3

## Three Reasoning Questions

**Q1: Valid medical criterion?**
Is "{{ entity_text }}" actually a valid medical criterion that should be grounded to a
terminology code? Examples of entities that are NOT groundable: consent, participation,
willingness, study enrollment, investigator discretion, geographic location.
If it is not a valid medical criterion, return should_skip=true.

**Q2: Derived entity?**
Is "{{ entity_text }}" a derived entity that maps to a more standard medical concept?
Examples:
- "age >= 18 years" → the concept is "age" (the numeric value is a filter, not the concept)
- "male" or "female" → maps to SNOMED gender concepts
- "BMI > 30" → the concept is "body mass index"
If derived, return is_derived=true and the standard medical concept term.

**Q3: Rephrase for better terminology search?**
Can "{{ entity_text }}" be rephrased as proper medical terminology to improve search results?
Examples:
- "high blood pressure" → "hypertension"
- "sugar diabetes" → "diabetes mellitus"
- "heart attack" → "myocardial infarction"
- "kidney failure" → "renal failure"
If rephrasing would help, return the rephrased query. Otherwise return null.

## Instructions

Respond with a brief clinical analysis. Address all three questions.
State whether the entity should be skipped, whether it is a derived entity (and the
standard term), and whether a rephrased query would improve terminology lookup.
Be concise — one sentence per question.
