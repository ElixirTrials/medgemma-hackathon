# Entity type → API mapping for terminology grounding via ToolUniverse
#
# routing_rules: maps entity type names to a list of API names to query.
# Use `skip: true` for entity types that should not be grounded.
#
# api_configs: defines how each API is accessed.
# - source: "tooluniverse" uses the ToolUniverse SDK (all systems)
# - tool_name: the ToolUniverse tool identifier for this system
#
# Note: Demographic entities are NOT skipped — age/gender grounding is attempted
# via UMLS/SNOMED. The MedGemma agentic reasoning loop handles derived entity
# mapping (age → birthDate concept) before retry attempts.
#
# Note: Consent entities ARE skipped — consent/participation criteria are not
# groundable to medical terminology codes.
