<objective>
Archive phase directories from completed milestones into `.planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-phases/`.

Use when `.planning/phases/` has accumulated directories from past milestones.

</execution_context>

<process>
Follow the cleanup workflow at @/Users/noahdolevelixir/.claude-elixirtrials/get-shit-done/workflows/cleanup.md.
Identify completed milestones, show a dry-run summary, and archive on confirmation.

<objective>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action - either executing an existing plan or creating the next one.

Provides situational awareness before continuing work.

</execution_context>

<process>
Execute the progress workflow from @/Users/noahdolevelixir/.claude-elixirtrials/get-shit-done/workflows/progress.md end-to-end.
Preserve all routing logic (Routes A through F) and edge case handling.

/gsd:execute-phase 43

---

<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

<context>
Phase: 43

**Flags:**
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.

<process>
Execute the execute-phase workflow from @/Users/noahdolevelixir/.claude-elixirtrials/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).
