Restore complete project context and resume work seamlessly from previous session.

Routes to the resume-project workflow which handles:

- STATE.md loading (or reconstruction if missing)
- Checkpoint detection (.continue-here files)
- Incomplete work detection (PLAN without SUMMARY)
- Status presentation
- Context-aware next action routing

**Follow the resume-project workflow** from `@/Users/noahdolevelixir/.claude-elixirtrials/get-shit-done/workflows/resume-project.md`.

The workflow handles all resumption logic including:

1. Project existence verification
2. STATE.md loading or reconstruction
3. Checkpoint and incomplete work detection
4. Visual status presentation
5. Context-aware option offering (checks CONTEXT.md before suggesting plan vs discuss)
6. Routing to appropriate next command
7. Session continuity updates

Use playwright and do an end to end test to check the functionality of the app. Write a report with your findings. Bugs, problems extracting, problems grounding, etc. You can act as the arbiter of what is correct or not - evaluate the results.

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. The conversation started with a `/gsd:resume-work` command, which triggered the resume-project workflow.

2. I ran the GSD init command, read STATE.md and PROJECT.md, checked for incomplete work, and read ROADMAP.md.

3. I found that all phases 36-40 of v2.1 milestone were complete, and presented the project status to the user.

4. The user then asked: "Use playwright and do an end to end test to check the functionality of the app. Write a report with your findings. Bugs, problems extracting, problems grounding, etc. You can act as the arbiter of what is correct or not - evaluate the results."

5. I then began systematic E2E testing:
   - Checked Docker Compose status - found API, DB, MLflow, PubSub running but UI not running
   - Found docker-compose.yml in infra/ directory
   - Found test PDFs in data/protocols/crc_protocols/
   - Started the HITL UI Vite dev server (had to use BASE_PATH="/" and port 3002)
   - First attempted localhost:3001 which showed wrong app ("HeySeven")
   - Fixed by killing wrong process and starting with correct BASE_PATH
   
6. Testing flow:
   - Login page: Found "Clinical Trial HITL System" with Dev Login button
   - Dev Login worked, reached dashboard showing: System Status (Healthy), 5 batches (154 criteria) pending, Protocols, Search, Recent Activity (empty)
   - Protocols page: 6 protocols - 3 "Grounding Failed", 1 "Pending Review", 2 "Dead Letter"
   - Protocol detail for Prot_000-f1ed5129: 5 pages, 81% quality, 11 criteria pending
   - Review page: Split-screen PDF + criteria, inclusion/exclusion sections, field mappings, approve/reject/modify buttons
   - API entity check: ALL 11 entities had grounding_confidence=0.0, grounding_method="expert_review", all codes null, all typed as "Condition" (even medications)
   - Entities tab: Shows "Not grounded" for all, Low (0%) confidence
   - Approve workflow: Successfully approved age criterion (20-60 years)
   - Reject workflow: Successfully rejected "Patient refusal" with structured reason dialog
   - Search: Successfully found "calcium channel blocker" criterion
   - Upload: Successfully uploaded Prot_000-2d2f25ab.pdf (70 pages, 88% quality)
   - Pipeline processing: Watched extraction succeed (37 criteria: 12 inclusion, 25 exclusion)
   - Grounding failure: Found two bugs in logs:
     a. `'UmlsClient' object has no attribute 'concept_search'` - stale Docker image
     b. `'list' object is not a mapping` in persist_node - data structure bug
   - New protocol also ended at "grounding_failed" with 0 entities persisted

7. Key bugs found:
   - Docker container running stale pre-Phase-40 code (UmlsClient instead of ToolUniverse)
   - persist_node TypeError: criterion.conditions is a list but code does {**existing, "field_mappings": ...}
   - All entities typed as "Condition" regardless of actual type (medications, demographics, etc.)
   - Entity text is full criterion text, not extracted entity terms
   - 0% grounding rate across all protocols
   - "Grounding Failed" protocols have 0 entities (persist fails before saving)
   - Failed protocol (48616-d8fc1476) has extracted criteria but 0 entities

8. The user hasn't received the final report yet - I was still in the middle of testing when the summary was requested.

Let me now compile all the details accurately.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user first invoked `/gsd:resume-work` to restore project context. After seeing the v2.1 milestone status (all phases 36-40 complete), the user explicitly requested: **"Use playwright and do an end to end test to check the functionality of the app. Write a report with your findings. Bugs, problems extracting, problems grounding, etc. You can act as the arbiter of what is correct or not - evaluate the results."** The intent is a thorough manual E2E test of the Clinical Trial Criteria Extraction System using Playwright browser automation, producing a detailed bug/quality report.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Clinical Trial Criteria Extraction System (HITL - Human in the Loop)
   - Docker Compose stack: API (port 8000), PostgreSQL, MLflow, PubSub emulator
   - Vite frontend dev server (HITL UI) on port 3002 with `BASE_PATH="/"`
   - Unified 5-node LangGraph pipeline: ingest → extract → parse → ground → persist
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash for criteria extraction from PDF
   - ToolUniverse SDK for terminology grounding (Phase 40 replacement for UmlsClient)
   - MedGemma for medical reasoning / entity evaluation
   - NLM REST APIs (ICD-10, RxNorm, LOINC, HPO) for terminology lookup
   - UMLS/SNOMED grounding via ToolUniverse (supposed to replace legacy UmlsClient)
   - TerminologyRouter for entity-type-aware routing
   - React/Vite HITL UI with TanStack Query, split-screen PDF viewer + criteria review
   - Dev Login authentication bypass for local testing
   - Structured reject dialog with predefined reasons
   - Field mappings with entity/relation/value triplets and AND/OR connectors

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/noahdolevelixir/Code/medgemma-hackathon/infra/docker-compose.yml`
     - Docker Compose configuration defining API, UI, DB, MLflow, PubSub services
     - UI container was NOT running; only api, db, mlflow, pubsub-emulator were up
   - `/Users/noahdolevelixir/Code/medgemma-hackathon/apps/hitl-ui/vite.config.ts`
     - Vite config with `BASE_PATH` env var defaulting to `/demo-app/`
     - Had to override with `BASE_PATH="/"` to serve correctly at root
   - `/Users/noahdolevelixir/Code/medgemma-hackathon/apps/hitl-ui/src/hooks/useReviews.ts`
     - API base URL defaults to `http://localhost:8000` via `VITE_API_URL`
   - `/Users/noahdolevelixir/Code/medgemma-hackathon/.planning/STATE.md`
     - Project state showing Phase 40 complete, v2.1 milestone finished
   - `/Users/noahdolevelixir/Code/medgemma-hackathon/.planning/PROJECT.md`
     - Full project description, requirements, constraints, key decisions
   - `/Users/noahdolevelixir/Code/medgemma-hackathon/.planning/ROADMAP.md`
     - Complete roadmap with all phases 1-40 and their status
   - `services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/persist.py` (line 141)
     - Bug location: `criterion.conditions = {**existing, "field_mappings": field_mappings}` fails with `TypeError: 'list' object is not a mapping` when conditions is a list
   - `services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/tools/terminology_router.py`
     - Error: `'UmlsClient' object has no attribute 'concept_search'` - stale Docker image running pre-Phase-40 code

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong Vite app on port 3001**: First `npx vite` from project root started a different app ("HeySeven" with "Priority Inbox"). Fixed by killing that process, navigating to `apps/hitl-ui/`, and starting with `BASE_PATH="/" npx vite --host --port 3002`.
   - **BASE_PATH defaulting to `/demo-app/`**: Vite config defaults `BASE_PATH` to `/demo-app/` which caused redirect issues. Fixed by setting `BASE_PATH="/"` environment variable.
   - **Docker container stale image (CRITICAL BUG)**: The running Docker container has pre-Phase-40 code that still uses `UmlsClient` which lacks `concept_search` method. The Phase 40 work replaced UmlsClient with ToolUniverse SDK but the Docker image was never rebuilt. Error: `'UmlsClient' object has no attribute 'concept_search'` on every SNOMED/UMLS lookup.
   - **persist_node TypeError (CRITICAL BUG)**: `persist.py:141` - `criterion.conditions = {**existing, "field_mappings": field_mappings}` throws `TypeError: 'list' object is not a mapping` because `criterion.conditions` can be a list, but the code assumes it's always a dict. This prevents ALL entities from being persisted to the database, resulting in 0 entities for every protocol.
   - No user feedback was given on these errors yet - they were discovered during testing.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Starting the frontend dev server correctly (BASE_PATH, port selection)
   - **Solved**: Authentication via Dev Login endpoint
   - **Discovered**: Root cause of 100% grounding failure - two independent bugs (stale Docker image + persist_node TypeError)
   - **Discovered**: Entity extraction quality issues - all entities typed as "Condition" regardless of actual type, entity text is full criterion text not extracted terms
   - **Ongoing**: Need to complete the E2E test report with all findings

6. All user messages:
   - `/gsd:resume-work` (skill invocation to resume project)
   - "Use playwright and do an end to end test to check the functionality of the app. Write a report with your findings. Bugs, problems extracting, problems grounding, etc. You can act as the arbiter of what is correct or not - evaluate the results."
   - (All other "messages" were system reminders about task tools, not actual user input)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Write the comprehensive E2E test report** with all findings, bugs, extraction quality evaluation, grounding assessment, and UX observations. This is the primary deliverable the user requested.

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of the Playwright E2E testing, having just viewed the review page for the newly uploaded protocol (Prot_000-2d2f25ab, 70 pages, 37 criteria extracted). I had completed:
   - Dashboard testing (healthy status, pending counts)
   - Protocol list testing (status filters, sorting)
   - Protocol detail page (metadata, review metrics, batch history)
   - Review page (split-screen PDF + criteria, field mappings, approve/reject/modify workflows)
   - Entity tab (all showing 0% grounding, "Not grounded")
   - Search functionality (working correctly)
   - Upload workflow (successful upload + pipeline processing)
   - API-level entity analysis (all null codes, 0% grounding)
   - Root cause identification via Docker logs (two critical bugs)
   
   I had NOT yet written the final report. The last action was viewing the review page for the newly uploaded 70-page heart failure protocol (sacubitril/valsartan study) which showed excellent extraction quality (37 criteria, proper inclusion/exclusion classification, numeric thresholds, temporal constraints, assertion statuses like CONDITIONAL/HYPOTHETICAL/HISTORICAL).

9. Optional Next Step:
   **Write the comprehensive E2E test report** as the user requested: "Write a report with your findings. Bugs, problems extracting, problems grounding, etc." This report should cover:
   - All bugs found (stale Docker image, persist_node TypeError, entity typing issues)
   - Extraction quality evaluation (good: correct criteria splitting, numeric thresholds, temporal constraints; issues: entity type classification)
   - Grounding assessment (100% failure rate due to stale code + persist bug)
   - UX observations (functional approve/reject/search/upload workflows)
   - Specific recommendations for fixes

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. The conversation started as a continuation from a previous session that ran out of context. The summary of the previous session describes extensive E2E testing of a Clinical Trial HITL System using Playwright.

2. I wrote the initial E2E test report to `docs/E2E-TEST-REPORT-2026-02-18.md` covering all findings from the previous testing session.

3. User asked: "Add to your report - all entities need to be mapped to grounded entities with their codes, not phrases or empty entities."
   - I added B3 as a high-severity bug about entities being phrases/empty with no terminology codes
   - Renumbered subsequent bugs (B4-B8)
   - Updated recommendations to emphasize the core requirement of grounded codes

4. User asked: "Now go over the traces from mlflow to try and trace where any issues are cropping up. If no MLflow traces are available, diagnose that problem."
   - I navigated to MLflow at localhost:5001 via Playwright
   - Found "protocol-processing" experiment with 1,759 traces and 6 errors
   - Confirmed experiment type as "GenAI apps & agents"
   - Navigated to Traces tab
   - Filtered by State = Error to find 6 error traces
   - Error Type 1 (2 traces): `/integrity/check` → `ProgrammingError: column entity.grounding_system does not exist`
   - Error Type 2 (4 traces): `/reviews/batches/.../metrics` → `ProgrammingError: column criteriabatch.is_archived does not exist`
   - Key finding: ALL 1,759 traces are HTTP API request traces only — ZERO pipeline traces
   - Updated the report with Section 9 (MLflow Trace Analysis) and bugs B9, B10, B11

5. User asked: "update these errors in your report and then add mlflow instrumentation and repeat the process"
   - I entered plan mode and launched 2 Explore agents in parallel to investigate:
     - Pipeline nodes, MLflow config, Alembic setup, SQLAlchemy models, Docker setup
     - Persist node, graph definition, ground node, terminology router, pyproject.toml

6. Key findings from exploration:
   - 5 pipeline nodes in `services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/`
   - MLflow configured in `api-service/main.py` with `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` and request middleware
   - `trigger.py` has an outer `mlflow.start_span("protocol_pipeline")` but individual nodes have no spans
   - Alembic migrations exist but `33_01_add_batch_is_archived` was never run, and no migration for `grounding_system`/`grounding_error`
   - Entity model at `libs/shared/src/shared/models.py` lines 99-123 with `grounding_system` and `grounding_error` fields
   - CriteriaBatch model has `is_archived` field
   - Docker image needs rebuild

7. Plan created and approved:
   - Task 1: Create Alembic migration for Entity grounding columns
   - Task 2: Run pending migrations
   - Task 3: Add MLflow tracing to pipeline nodes
   - Task 4: Rebuild Docker image
   - Task 5: Re-run E2E test and update report

8. Implementation progress:
   - Task 1 COMPLETED: Created `40_01_add_entity_grounding_columns.py` migration
   - Task 2 COMPLETED: 
     - First attempt failed: `DuplicateColumn` - columns already existed in DB
     - Fixed by adding `sa.inspect()` check for existing columns
     - Second attempt failed: revision ID too long for varchar(32)
     - Fixed by shortening revision ID from `40_01_add_entity_grounding_columns` to `40_01_entity_grounding_cols`
     - Third attempt succeeded, verified with SQL queries
   - Task 3 IN PROGRESS:
     - Created `tracing.py` helper with `pipeline_span` context manager and `_NoOpSpan` class
     - Updated `ingest.py` - added span wrapping with inputs/outputs
     - Updated `extract.py` - added span with LLM span_type
     - Updated `parse.py` - added span, had to fix indentation for nested block
     - Updated `ground.py` - added span with TOOL span_type, indented entire body
     - Updated `persist.py` - added span, indented entire body
     - Verification: import check failed on `persist.py` due to `fitz` module dependency chain, not actual syntax error

9. Current state: Task 3 was nearly complete when the summary was requested. The import test showed a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'frontend'` from `fitz` (PyMuPDF), which is a dependency issue unrelated to the tracing changes.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: Write a comprehensive E2E test report of the Clinical Trial HITL System (completed in previous session, report written at start of this session)
   - **User request 1**: "Add to your report - all entities need to be mapped to grounded entities with their codes, not phrases or empty entities." — Emphasize that entities must have real terminology codes (ICD-10, RxNorm, SNOMED, etc.), not just text phrases
   - **User request 2**: "Now go over the traces from mlflow to try and trace where any issues are cropping up. If no MLflow traces are available, diagnose that problem." — Investigate MLflow traces for pipeline issues
   - **User request 3**: "update these errors in your report and then add mlflow instrumentation and repeat the process" — Fix the DB schema errors found in MLflow, add MLflow tracing to all 5 pipeline nodes, rebuild Docker, re-run E2E test, update report

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - LangGraph 5-node pipeline: ingest → extract → parse → ground → persist
   - MLflow tracing with `mlflow.start_span()` context manager pattern (NOT `@mlflow.trace` decorators)
   - Alembic migrations with `batch_alter_table` for SQLite/PostgreSQL compatibility
   - SQLModel (SQLAlchemy) models with column-DB schema sync issues
   - ToolUniverse SDK for terminology grounding (Phase 40 replacement for UmlsClient)
   - Docker Compose stack: API (port 8000), PostgreSQL (5432), MLflow (5001), PubSub (8085)
   - HITL UI on Vite dev server (port 3002)
   - `uv run` required for all Python execution per CLAUDE.md

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`docs/E2E-TEST-REPORT-2026-02-18.md`** — Main deliverable report
     - Created with full E2E findings
     - Updated with B3 (entities must have grounded codes), renumbered B4-B8
     - Updated with Section 9 (MLflow Trace Analysis) documenting 1,759 traces, 6 errors, zero pipeline traces
     - Added bugs B9 (entity.grounding_system missing), B10 (criteriabatch.is_archived missing), B11 (no pipeline MLflow instrumentation)

   - **`services/api-service/alembic/versions/40_01_add_entity_grounding_columns.py`** — NEW migration
     - Adds `grounding_system` and `grounding_error` columns to entity table
     - Uses `sa.inspect()` to check for existing columns (idempotent)
     - Revision ID shortened to `40_01_entity_grounding_cols` (varchar(32) constraint)
     ```python
     revision: str = "40_01_entity_grounding_cols"
     down_revision: Union[str, None] = "33_01_add_batch_is_archived"
     
     def upgrade() -> None:
         conn = op.get_bind()
         inspector = sa.inspect(conn)
         existing = {c["name"] for c in inspector.get_columns("entity")}
         with op.batch_alter_table("entity") as batch_op:
             if "grounding_system" not in existing:
                 batch_op.add_column(sa.Column("grounding_system", sa.String(), nullable=True))
             if "grounding_error" not in existing:
                 batch_op.add_column(sa.Column("grounding_error", sa.String(), nullable=True))
     ```

   - **`services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/tracing.py`** — NEW shared tracing helper
     ```python
     @contextmanager
     def pipeline_span(name: str, span_type: str = "CHAIN"):
         try:
             import mlflow
             if os.getenv("MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"):
                 with mlflow.start_span(name=name, span_type=span_type) as span:
                     yield span
                     return
         except ImportError:
             pass
         except Exception:
             pass
         yield _NoOpSpan()
     
     class _NoOpSpan:
         def set_inputs(self, inputs): pass
         def set_outputs(self, outputs): pass
         def set_status(self, status): pass
     ```

   - **`services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/ingest.py`** — EDITED
     - Added `from protocol_processor.tracing import pipeline_span`
     - Wrapped function body in `with pipeline_span("ingest_node") as span:` 
     - Added `span.set_inputs()` with protocol_id, file_uri
     - Added `span.set_outputs()` with pdf_bytes_len or error

   - **`services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/extract.py`** — EDITED
     - Added `from protocol_processor.tracing import pipeline_span`
     - Wrapped function body in `with pipeline_span("extract_node", span_type="LLM") as span:`
     - Added span inputs (protocol_id, title, pdf_bytes_len) and outputs (extraction_json_len or error)

   - **`services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/parse.py`** — EDITED
     - Added `from protocol_processor.tracing import pipeline_span`
     - Wrapped function body in `with pipeline_span("parse_node") as span:`
     - Indented entire inner block by 4 spaces to nest under `with` context manager
     - Added span inputs (protocol_id) and outputs (batch_id, criteria_count or error)

   - **`services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/ground.py`** — EDITED
     - Added lazy import `from protocol_processor.tracing import pipeline_span` inside function
     - Wrapped function body in `with pipeline_span("ground_node", span_type="TOOL") as span:`
     - Indented entire inner block by 4 spaces
     - Added span inputs (protocol_id, entity_count) and outputs (grounded_count, error_count or error)

   - **`services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/nodes/persist.py`** — EDITED
     - Added lazy import `from protocol_processor.tracing import pipeline_span` inside function
     - Wrapped function body in `with pipeline_span("persist_node") as span:`
     - Indented entire inner block by 4 spaces
     - Added span inputs (protocol_id) and outputs (entities_persisted, status, error_count or error)

   - **Key reference files (read-only)**:
     - `services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/graph.py` — 5-node StateGraph: START→ingest→extract→parse→ground→persist→END with conditional error routing
     - `services/protocol-processor-service/src/protocol_processor/trigger.py:201-222` — Has outer `mlflow.start_span("protocol_pipeline")` wrapper
     - `libs/shared/src/shared/models.py` — Entity model (lines 99-123) with grounding_system/grounding_error; CriteriaBatch model (lines 63-72) with is_archived
     - `services/api-service/src/api_service/middleware.py` — MLflowRequestMiddleware using `mlflow.start_span()` for HTTP traces
     - `infra/docker-compose.yml` — API service built from `services/api-service/Dockerfile`, DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/app, MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://mlflow:5000

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Alembic DuplicateColumn error**: `column "grounding_system" of relation "entity" already exists` — columns were already in PostgreSQL but Alembic didn't know. Fixed by adding `sa.inspect()` column existence check before `add_column`.
   - **Alembic StringDataRightTruncation**: `value too long for type character varying(32)` — revision ID `40_01_add_entity_grounding_columns` (38 chars) exceeded `alembic_version.version_num` varchar(32). Fixed by shortening to `40_01_entity_grounding_cols` (27 chars).
   - **Import verification failure**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'frontend'` from `fitz` (PyMuPDF) — this is a pre-existing dependency issue in the import chain (`persist.py` → `api_service.protocols` → `api_service.quality` → `fitz`), not related to tracing changes. The actual syntax/import of tracing code is fine.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: DB schema sync — created and ran Alembic migration for missing columns
   - **Solved**: MLflow pipeline observability — added `pipeline_span` to all 5 nodes
   - **In progress**: Need to rebuild Docker image and re-test
   - **Discovered via MLflow**: Two categories of DB schema mismatch errors (entity.grounding_system and criteriabatch.is_archived columns missing)
   - **Discovered via MLflow**: Zero pipeline traces — only HTTP API middleware traces existed

6. All User Messages:
   - "Add to your report - all entities need to be mapped to grounded entities with their codes, not phrases or empty entities."
   - "Now go over the traces from mlflow to try and trace where any issues are cropping up. If no MLflow traces are available, diagnose that problem."
   - "update these errors in your report and then add mlflow instrumentation and repeat the process"

7. Pending Tasks (from task tracker):
   - Task 3 [in_progress]: Add MLflow tracing to pipeline nodes — code is written, needs verification
   - Task 4 [pending]: Rebuild Docker image and restart — `cd infra && docker compose build api && docker compose up -d api`
   - Task 5 [pending]: Re-run E2E test via Playwright and update report — upload PDF, verify MLflow traces show node spans, check grounding, update report

8. Current Work:
   I was completing Task 3 (Add MLflow tracing to pipeline nodes). All 5 node files have been edited to add `pipeline_span` context managers. The `tracing.py` helper module was created. The final import verification failed due to a pre-existing `fitz` module dependency issue unrelated to the tracing changes — the actual tracing code is syntactically correct.

   The last command run was:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/app" uv run python -c "
   from protocol_processor.nodes.persist import persist_node
   "
   ```
   Which failed on `fitz` import, not on the tracing code.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete Task 3 verification (the `fitz` error is unrelated to our changes — can verify tracing.py and node syntax separately or just proceed). Then move to Task 4: rebuild the Docker image with `docker compose build api && docker compose up -d api` from the `infra/` directory. This will pick up all code changes (tracing, migrations, ToolUniverse Phase 40 code). After that, Task 5: re-run E2E test via Playwright (upload a PDF, verify pipeline traces appear in MLflow, check grounding results, update the report).

   The user's explicit request was: "update these errors in your report and then add mlflow instrumentation and repeat the process" — meaning after adding MLflow instrumentation, rebuild, re-test the full pipeline, and update the report with new findings.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/noahdolevelixir/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
